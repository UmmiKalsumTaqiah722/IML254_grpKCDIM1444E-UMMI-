      <p> <b><font size="10">YG ENTERTAINMENT</font></b> <br><br> Yang Hyun-suk, a former member of Seo Taiji and Boys, formed YG Entertainment in 1996. With early hits like Jinusean and 1TYM, the company swiftly became a major force in the K-pop scene. With the release of Big Bang in 2006 and 2NE1 in 2009, the company achieved unimaginable success and established its image as a producer of creative and marketable talents. 2010 saw YG go public, and 2012 saw Psy's worldwide smash "Gangnam Style" gain previously unheard-of levels of attention from around the world. After Blackpink's 2016 debut, YG's global popularity grew even more, positioning them as one of the most well-known girl groups globally. YG succeeded despite the scandals that resulted in Yang Hyun-suk's departure in 2019, growing the number of artists and collaborating with foreign countries. Important musicians like Blackpink, Psy, Big Bang, and 2NE1 have contributed significantly to YG's success. The company's innovations, such as YG Family Concerts, different sub-labels, and clever international alliances, have secured its position as a major player in the entertainment sector, consistently influencing contemporary K-pop trends and expanding its influence internationally.</p>
